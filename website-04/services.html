      <h2>From 'A Million Miles of Shredded Paper: Enron and the 90s'</h2>
      <p><i>Two towers, in the beating heart of a city. Glistening symbols of the triumph of capitalism and its boundless success. Of the American Dream. Thousands of jobs, of lives, inside. Technology advancing at breakneck speeds, poised to change the world in so many different ways. Hundreds of millions of dollars zipping in and out of existence with key and penstrokes. A power unmatched, an empire stretching the world over. Everyone who was anyone wanted in, wanted a piece of that power, a cut of that money. A profound sense that nothing could or would go wrong, that this money, this power, would forever expand, forever change everything. But by the end of 2001, there would be nothing left of this empire built on sand. Nothing but a million miles of shredded paper, floating on the wind.</i></p>
      <h2>From 'CIA Transcript of the Broadcast Intrusion on 06/29/72'</h2>
      <p><i>Humanity is a beautiful and wonderful species. From the moment you were capable of it, you looked up at the stars and wondered what might be out there, who might be out there. Some of the first stories you ever told each other were attempts to explain what was in the great beyond. Where others might have seen a cold, lonely place, one of despair and futility, you saw wonder, and majesty.</i></p>
      <p><i>As soon as you invented devices that enabled you to look at far away things, you pointed them up. As soon as you invented devices that enabled you to create immense thrust, you used them to see first-hand what the world beyond your world looked like. Even as dangerous as it was, you still braved the journey, you still tried as hard as you could, because if someone was out there, you couldn't bear to see them as lonely as you've been. You are a social species, a wonderfully social species, and even though sometimes you were scared, and sometimes you were mean, you've matched every one expression of hatred with ten expressions of love. The greatest wish of your science-fiction writers has not been to conquer endless worlds, nor to kill hordes of beings unlike you, but to make friends, to know that you're not alone, and that you are loved. It has been the collective will of your species since you were first able to conceive of it.</i></p>
