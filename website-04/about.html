      <p>Our chief writer is <b>April Dean</b>, who also created this website. He was born in southern California in 2000, grew up in the Seattle area, and has since lived all across the country on his manic quest for truth, justice, and some good, wholesome fun. He created this firm as a means of furthering his one true love in life - writing. He's been writing prose and non-fiction since he was 3, and he hasn't stopped since. He has crank opinions on more obscure political topics than you're aware of, and can get into a heated argument with anyone, given a few minutes of prep time. He's a fervent believer and disbeliever in every occult discipline man has ever charted, and is rumored to have been scouted by the New York Yankees as their short-stop. Unfortunately for them, April carries a life-long fervent hatred of the Yankees, and will under no circumstances accept such an offer. He is also a terrific liar, and projects that around half of the things written on this page are less than true - figuring out which half is the truth is your mystery to solve.</p>
      <br>
