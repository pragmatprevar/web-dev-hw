        [Verse 1]
        You should've seen my cursive back then
        Every letter was above the line
        My Ps and Qs raised their stems
        So nothing crossed beneath
        I'm a little better now

        [Chorus]
        You never lifted your voice
        You never raised your hand
        You never showed me your inhuman
        You understand

        [Post-Chorus 1]
        Art gets what it wants and art gets what it deserves

        [Verse 2]
        Most people are jokes, but you're so real
        Most of the time that I use the word "you"
        Well, you know that I'm mostly singing about you
        You swore you'd never use the face that your ex invented
        So let's meet up in uncanny valley

        [Chorus]
        You never lifted your voice
        You never raised your hand
        I only showed you my inhuman
        You understand

        [Post-Chorus 2]
        You'll get what you want and you'll get what you deserve
        You'll get what you want and you'll get what you deserve
