        [Verse 1]
        You should've seen my cursive back then
        Every letter was above the line
        My Ps and Qs raised their stems
        So nothing crossed beneath
        I'm a little better now

        [Chorus]
        You never lifted your voice
        You never raised your hand
        You never showed me your inhuman
        You understand

        [Post-Chorus 1]
        Art gets what it wants and art gets what it deserves

        [Verse 2]
        Most people are jokes, but you're so real
        Most of the time that I use the word "you"
        Well, you know that I'm mostly singing about you
        You swore you'd never use the face that your ex invented
        So let's meet up in uncanny valley

        [Chorus]
        You never lifted your voice
        You never raised your hand
        I only showed you my inhuman
        You understand

        [Post-Chorus 2]
        You'll get what you want and you'll get what you deserve
        You'll get what you want and you'll get what you deserve

        [Outro]
        I am a good person. I am a powerful person. I don't believe in evil. I think that evil is an idea created by others to avoid dealing with their own nature. I understand my own nature. Good and evil have nothing to do with it. I understand myself. I control myself. I control everything within myself. My domain is my domain. I can lie on my back and affect the lives of those I love without moving a finger. But I would only affect them in good ways. I don't waste time on evil. I'm a good person. Is this thing on?
        Do you know about Jesus? Do you really know? All you know is what you've been told. Listen with your heart. Sing with your heart. You've just been singing about girls. What do you know about girls? Fuck... Why are you so tense? You've gotta start singing with love in your heart. Is this on?
        Adam, are you there? A pain star has entered your house, but what are you going to do about it? Are you going to touch it? It only happens once every thousand years, maybe even two thousand years. And how long is a year, really?
        It's almost Halloween. I haven't done shit this year. It's been a summer—it's been a summer since February, I was in Australia. God. California? Then what? June, July, August, a month in Europe. I can't even go to Ikea anymore, I've got flashbacks. Fuck! You should see the lights that I got there, I think you'd like them. I think that– I think you'd like them a lot!
        Isn't this where...
