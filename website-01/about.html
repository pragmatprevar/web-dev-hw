    <p>Emma Lazarus was an author from New York City. She was born in 1849 into a large Sephardic Jewish family, quickly developing a love for poetry. In 1883, she wrote The New Colossus to raise money to build a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty, going largely forgotten until 1903, when her friend Georgina Schuyler successfully lobbied to get the poem printed on a plaque on the inner wall of the pedestal she helped raise money for. Lazarus was active in agitating for the rights of immigrants, the Jewish community, and the cause of Georgism. She died in 1887, likely from Hodgkin lymphoma that she contracted on a trip to Europe.</p>
