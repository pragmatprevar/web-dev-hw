1. I took this class because web design has always interested me, and I've always been fascinated by the concept of being able to make websites for myself.
2. I hope to learn from this class the basics of web design such that I can make small websites for various projects I might embark on in the future. I also hope to be able to look at websites in a new light by being able to comprehend the decisions that went into designing them.
