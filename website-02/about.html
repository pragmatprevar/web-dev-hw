    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>I was originally stumped about what to do with this project, until I remembered my other interests - my magical interests especially. I wagered that most people would not be aware of sigils and their craft, and that as such it would make for an interesting instructable page.</p>
    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>Sigils, as previously mentioned, have many, many uses in magical practice, and creating sigils is one of the most basic skills towards focusing energy for worldly effect. Though I surmise few reading this page will look too deeply into these sorts of topics, the wider dissemination of magical practice is always a worthwhile goal to me.</p>
    <h2>Where?</h2>
    <p>As I have provided at the bottom of each page, my primary book for consultation on this kind of elementary sigilwork is Peter Carroll's Liber Null and Pyschonaut, but there are many other resources that touch on some of the same topics. Aleister Crowley's Magick: Liber ABA touches on sigils and a plethora of other topics, but it is quite the dense tome.</p>
