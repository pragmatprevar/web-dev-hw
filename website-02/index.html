    <h1>Constructing Sigils</h1>
    <p>A sigil is one of the most common elements of any magical practice, and can be great fun even for those not inclined towards believing in such things. A sigil is, in short, a symbol that focuses energy towards an idea through means of abstraction. The magician can focus on the symbol, and thus the idea, on a sublimated level that bypasses typical thought using language.</p>
